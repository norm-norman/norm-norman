## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Norm. While my professional experience is primarily in full-stack web development, I enjoy a variety of types of development in my free time (which is hopefully clear by my list of projects lol).

Currently, my big project is something I'm calling Collate - what will eventually an open source newsletter organizing app. I _might_ eventually put up a fully hosted and managed version for cheap, but one step at a time right now.

Besides that, I've been going back through some old textbooks from college and refamiliarizing myself with microelectronics and embedded systems in preparation to start trying to build some devices from scratch.

If any of my work sounds interesting and/or you'd like to collaborate on something, feel free to send me a [LinkedIn message](https://www.linkedin.com/in/norm-norman/)!
