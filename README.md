I'm **Norm**.  

While my professional experience is primarily in **full-stack web development**, I enjoy a variety of types of development in my free time (which is hopefully clear by my list of projects lol).

---

### Current Project

My big project is something I'm calling **Collate** — what will eventually be an **open source newsletter organizing app**.  
I _might_ eventually put up a fully hosted and managed version for cheap, but one step at a time right now.

---

### What I'm Learning

Besides that, I've been going back through some old textbooks from college and refamiliarizing myself with **microelectronics** and **embedded systems** in preparation to start trying to build some devices from scratch.

In addition, I've recently switched my daily driver to **Linux** and have been enjoying customizing my system more than I've previously done. This has led me down the neverending rabbit hole of "de-corporatizing" and self hosting as much as possible. Once I have some more time I'm excited to put some focus towards my home network to train my **networking** muscles a bit.
